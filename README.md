# Robot TS

This library is inspired by older unmaintained libraries like [octalmage/robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs)
and [Robot/robot-js](https://github.com/Robot/robot-js). The goal is to provide cross-platform controls for various
devices such as keyboard, mouse, and screen for Node.js applications.

**Supported system:**

- MacOS
- Windows **(not tested yet)**

In case of Linux, please, create issue and leave a star and I will implement support. Right now I want to focus on port to
Node.js using Node-API.
